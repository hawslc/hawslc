I am a high school student that likes coding a bit.
Some of my accomplishments include:
<br>
Solving the first 100 problems on <a href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a>
<br>
Writing many small games: <a href="https://hawslc.itch.io/">Itch.io Profile</a>

I also made a YouTube channel in middle school, but I am still proud of it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfb0B6sR6Z4">Favorite Video</a>
